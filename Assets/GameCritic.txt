Is the Game Easy or Hard?
Too easy, the reasons go as follows, the obstacles are too slow and therefore easy to dodge, the game is a usual runner, and also the power ups add a bit too much time.

What could be done to make it Easier or Harder?
Game needs more obstacles/challenges, therefore it needs a goal.

3 things that give a "wow" factor.
Obstacles appear random positions on map which definetly adds into a bit of a challenge, the Powerups definetly give more time allowing a longer gameplay, and the setting as a runner is a rather nice.

Parts that are fun
It is fun to catch powerups, and is fun to navigate between obstacles, it is also fun to aim for high-scores.

Parts that are tedious
Powerups move too fast, Player moves too slow, and Obstacles move too slow. Another thing is that the map is basically the same thing, would ike to see a variety of the map like even some terrain, same goes with the powerups and obstacles, both of those do not vary in any way either, plus the game is just a generic runner game, there's nothing really interesting or engaging about it and it also is lacking of any goal of any kind.
